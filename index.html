        <p>I don't care if this is cringe, this blog is just for me and my memories. Hi guys, I'm procrastinating right now bc i genuinely am so burnt out in this internship. I thought it would be 
            cool to learn html. Fun fact, I literally touched HTML in 3rd grade a couple of times (thank you khan academy) 
            and I never touched it again. My dad was big on programming but now I can kinda code too!!!</p>
