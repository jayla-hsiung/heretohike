        <h3>First Time Trail Running - 08/06/2025</h3>

        <p>
            Today, I went on my first ever trail run. I went with my friend who’s super fit. 
            You know how people who did xc in high school can either do it unseriously or lock 
            in and become a running fiend? She’s the latter. She also will very likely be hiking 
            the AT with me after she completes her 5th year masters.
        </p>
        <p>
            So at 7:45 am, she picked me up in her stick shift car (isn’t she so cool?). She also 
            brought her dog called Newt (named after Sir Isaac Newton, who else?!). So here I am, 
            a bit worried about the hills and terrain but super stoked to try this activity I probably
             would’ve been too scared to try alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trail was typical NJ nature, but was really nice considering how close it was to our hometown. 
            There were streams galore, which Newt loved. She was like a bullet and so energetic. She would stop 
            and sniff and frolic and would sprint ahead (and the water on her fur would get on us) and repeat. 
            There was a scary moment where we thought we lost her, and another one where she (I think) ran onto 
            the streets. My friend told her to stop so she stopped in the middle of the street! So maybe this 
            would be better if there were no cars but oh well. We do what we can.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think this trail was a perfect introduction to trail running. I don’t know why but I was shocked 
            when I realized that this was basically what we do in cross country. So basically I’ve trail ran for
             4 seasons back in high school. The only difference was this one was a bit rooty-er and actually less 
             hilly than real xc courses! There were a few moments when I was like are my ankles ok and my knees 
             kinda hurt… But I survived and enjoyed it!
        </p>
        <p>
            There was also a silly moment when we almost got lost. We didn’t bring our phones and only had our 
            gamins (without maps loaded). So my friend (who had only gone here one time before) was like let’s 
            take this turn! So we went and it was pretty! So a bit later we’re like wait where are we and maybe 
            this takes us back to the trail we were on before. So I turn on the track back feature on my watch 
            and we continue onwards. It’s so funny because for a second it really seemed like the trail would 
            connect back. But we continued and it seemed like it wouldn’t really work, so we turned back. So 
            in the end, we ended up doing slightly more than 5, when we really meant to do 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Final thoughts: I would totally do this again! Getting my nature fix in while also getting miles in!
        </p>
        <p>
            Vibes rn: Still tired, but happy that I ran. Maybe will go on a hike with another friend and will 
            workout with yet another friend (will be sore…)
