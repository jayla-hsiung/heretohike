        <h3>Who Needs LighterPacks When You're Proficient in Google Sheets (Put that on my Resume) - 08/01/2025</h3>
        <p>
            Yesterday, I went on a crazy person rampage and weighed all my gear on a scale. Yes, even floss.
            And yes, I know how to use formulas (don't think anyone was asking). Since I'm a woman in STEM and can 
            make charts on Sheets, I figured that this would be my version of LighterPacks. I went on it once and found
            it infuriating to add stuff to it. Like please. It's not that efficient to use. To be fair I'm the psycho 
            who calculates her grades on sheets. I thought that was normal? Yeah, I probably will make spreadsheets galore
            for when I inevitably am bored and decide to plan my entire thruhike(s). Back to my point. I finally weighed 
            all of my gear! And now I know my baseweight. (Ok I didn't weigh the clothes that would be in my pack...) It's
            about 16-18 pounds which isn't bad! I'm yapping about charts but I have yet to make them haha. I'll do it later...

            <br>Upgrade! [Category, Current, To buy, Weight saved, Notes]:
            <br>Sleeping bag, Kelty Cosmic Ultra 20 Woman, Enlightened Equipment Revelation Quilt, &lt; 1lbs, Expensive... 
            Not worth it right now because I got that bag back in May. And I do like it; it's just heavy!
            <br>Stove, MSR Whisperlite, SOTO Windmaster, &gt; 0.5lbs, Free vintage stove from neighbor. I feel so cool 
            <del>lighting</del> priming it (and scared). But my stove weighing over a pound is crazy...
            <br>Portable Charger, a really heavy anker one (over a pound), a lighter nightcore one, prob over half a pound,
            I can't justify it! That's insanely heavy!!!
            <br>Pot, Vintage Aluminum 1L Bulldog Pot, Stanco Grease Pot (or when I have more money, a titanium one), few ounces, 
            Ok dropping a couple of ounces for only 15 bucks is so reasonable
            <br>
            <br>Conclusion:
            <br>If I can drop a pound for about 120 bucks, that's not bad. Not saying I would do it now, but maybe after I get 
            Christmas money :D
            <br>
            <br>Vibes rn: Still tired and boggled that I did this instead of being in bed 40 mins ago (at 10pm; guys, 
            I'm really tired...)
