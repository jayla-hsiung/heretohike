        <h3>In Praise of Backyard Cowboy Camping - 08/01/2025</h3>
        <p>
            I crave being outdoors and on the trail, but sometimes it really isn't convenient to go on a quick overnighter in 
            Harriman. Maybe it's a weekday night or you have plans the next day. But this is when backyard cowboy camping 
            rocks. Going to bed with the crickets chirping and waking up with the sun and the sound of the birds is the perfect 
            reset that my brain needs. Thus, tonight I'm about to backyard cowboy camp. I can't wait. You can't call it lame until you've 
            tried it...
