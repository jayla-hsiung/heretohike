        <h3>Reflecting on My Week Of Cowboy Camping - 08/09/2025</h3>

        <p>
            To be more accurate, I spent a week and a day outside cowboy camping. For the most part, 
            I stayed by myself with my sleeping bag, pillow, sleeping pad, and the bugs for company. 
            But for 2 special (and different days), I was with 2 friends. Friend number one really 
            enjoyed it and thought it was super nice to wake up with the sun. Friend number two was 
            pretty eh about it. She thought it was nice, but not something she would do on her own. 
            Maybe this is because she has higher standards when it comes to sleeping and whatnot?
            <br>
            I kind of forgot why I decided to do this, and I just remembered now. This was the tail 
            end of my internship, and I felt very burnt out and unmotivated and stuck. I was stuck and 
            trapped in my inaction, and I procrastinated a lot with screens. It was a vicious cycle I 
            could never escape. This was a simple way to reconnect and add a little bit of something 
            that I love.

Anywho, here’s what I noticed:
- Ridiculous amount of mosquito bites?
    - Did not put on bug spray (I would’ve if I had picaridin).
    - Also did not keep limbs in/under sleeping bag at all times… 
    - Lips itchy/flakey/dry from bug spray?
- Late to bed, early to rise…
    - Tired! But able to function and get stuff done because of the sunlight
    - Wake up naturally from sunlight at around 7:30
    - I don’t know why, but I wouldn’t go to bed on time? (Definitely a me problem)
    - I’m ridiculously sensitive to any kind of light, morning, night, anything

Um also, I washed my sheets and I was too lazy to put them back on?

Vibes rn: In the airport, about to fly out to PDX to visit fam! Super duper tired (per usual), but today I woke up at like 6:50 because I was with friend number one in the city and we were going to volunteer! Honestly, 10/10 morning. We volunteered at a soup kitchen-y organization in alphabet city and ran back (kinda) to her apartment!
